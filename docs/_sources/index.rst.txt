:any:`wagner-fischer/index`
    An expository note to describe how to implement the Wagner-Fischer
    algorithm -- a general algorithm to compute edit distance -- with a
    special attention to algorithmic efficiency.

:any:`20191127-charec`
    A toy handwriting recognition program using Levenshtein distance.
    I wrote this program mainly to show that Levenshtein distance is applicable to
    a wide range of objects (i.e. not just for strings).
