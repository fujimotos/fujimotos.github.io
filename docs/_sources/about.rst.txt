Books
-----

Talking about private stuffs, my biggest passion is *books*. I mean I read books. A LOT.

Here is some book recommendations:

Primo Levi "If this is a Man" (1947)
    Everything by Levi is worth reading. He is a stunningly honest writer with a genuine message to tell the world. I also strongly recommend his last work "The Drowned and the Saved" (1986).

Svetlana Alexievich "Secondhand Time" (2013)
    Alexievich is a modern genius. Basically she single-handedly created a whole new poetic frontier that is called "polyphonic writings". I didn't thought such a literary expression even can be possible until her work.

James Tiptree Jr "The Girl Who Was Plugged In" (1974)
    I cannot overstate how much I love her works. Her novels often go for a kind of frantic courage, where the protagonist makes a desperate effort to fight the inhuman System, nonetheless the odds being slim, because, you know, we human have souls to be saved.

E.T. Cook "Florence Nightingale" (1913)
    I first learned about Florence Nightingale thorough a notorious book "Florence Nightingale: Avenging Angel" by Hugh Small. It was an astonishing read for me, because, even through the lenses of her foes, Nightingale seems like a real intellectual giant.

Herodotus "Histories" (BC500?)
    I really wish that there were a dozen of Herodotus instead of one. His work is rich in knowledge, sometimes bogus (in Book 3, he talks about `dog-sized furry ants <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold-digging_ant>`_) and totally enjoyable.

Other works I liked:

- Dan Charles "Lords Of The Harvest" (2003)
- Richard Bookstaber "A Demon of Our Own Design" (2007)
- Philip Reeve "Here Lies Arthur" (2007)
- Kazuo Ishiguro "The Remains of the Day" (1989)

If you're into Japanese poetry, here is the finest one in my opinion:

.. epigraph::

    踊り場に 幾度も揺れた 影たちが 私と共に 消える三月
    
    -- 野口あや子
